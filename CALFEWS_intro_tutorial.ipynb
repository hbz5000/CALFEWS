    "## Setting simulation parameters\n",
    "The main parameters file for CALFEWS is ``runtime_params.ini``. This file allows the user to change the type of simulation, the input data, output data characteristics, etc. Be sure to follow the instructions at the top of the file regarding syntax - failing to do so may result in improper parameter parsing."

    "The most important parameters are:\n",
    "1. `model_mode`: This defines which type of simulation is run. There are four defined modes at present:\n",
    "    1. `validation`: Validation mode runs over the historical time period for which good data exists (water years 1997-2016) and incorporates major changes to environmental regulations and water supply infrastructure over that period. This is used to validate model outputs against historical reservoir storage, delta pumping, groundwater bank accounts, etc. \n",
    "    1. `simulation`: Simulation mode takes a particular \"scenario\" of environmental regulations and infrastructure, and holds them fixed over an entire simulation. The scenario will be discussed below under `scenario_name`. This can be carried out for any input time series, such as the longer 111-year reconstructed dataset used by Zeff et al. (2020). Simulation mode is useful for risk-based analyses under present or future conditions.\n",
    "    1. `sensitivity`: Sensitivity mode runs a sensitivity analysis over uncertain model variables such as irrigation demand or the stringency of environmental regulations. Sensitivity mode can dispatch many independent simulations in parallel on HPC resources. However, *sensitivity mode is not fully finished at present*.\n",
    "    1. `climate_ensemble`: Climate ensemble mode runs an ensemble of present and future climate model projections through CALFEWS. This mode can also take advantage of parallelized dispatch.\n",
    "1. `flow_input_type` and `flow_input_source`: These parameters dictate which input data is used for the model, for all modes except validation, which always uses the historical dataset. These parameters will be discussed in the \"Using different hydrologic inputs\" section below.\n",
    "1. `scenario_name`: The scenario name dictates the environmental and infrastructure scenario that is used for all modes other than Validation mode (which uses the historical regulations and infrastructure). The default (used by Zeff et al. (2020)) is conditions as of water year 2017. The only other scenario currently offered is ``FKC_capacity_rehab_full``, in which the Friant-Kern Canal, which has seen reduced conveyance capacity over time due to subsidence, is restored to its original capacity. Other scenarios will be available soon.\n",
    "1. `short_test`: To run a short test, this parameter can be set to the number of days that you would like to run (e.g., 365). If set to -1, the entire simulation will be run.\n",
    "1. `output_directory`: The directory where model output will be stored. Default is the \"results\" folder, but this can be changed. Note that the path should be relative to the repository base directory.\n",
    "1. `print_log`: If True, print statements, errors, etc., will be output to a text file. Else it defaults to the terminal.\n",
    "1. `clean_output`: If True, only non-zero time series will be included in the HDF5 model output. If False, all time series will be included, even if zero at all dates.\n",
    "1. `save_full`: Save Model objects from simulation as Pickle file, in addition to the HDF5 output? This should be turned off for sensitivity analyses due to their size. But at least one simulation's output is necessary for visualizing model output.\n",
    "1. `parallel_mode`: Run in parallel (True) or serial (False)?\n",
    "1. `cluster_mode`: Run on HPC cluster, or single machine? Only matters if running in parallel.\n",
    "1. `num_nodes`: Number of nodes to use (only matters if running on a cluster in parallel).\n",
    "1. `processors_per_node`: Number of processors per node (only matters if running on a cluster in parallel).\n",
    "1. `num_processors`: Number of processors to use on computer (only matters if running in parallel but NOT on a cluster).\n",
    "\n",
    "See `runtime_params_validation.ini` for an example of how to run the validation experiment from Zeff et al. (2020) on a laptop."

For validation mode, the inputs include historical snow, streamflow, precipitation, evaporation, and urban water demand observations over the 1997-2016 water years.
